Hello there,

Welcome to Computer Society of India and thank you for registering on the CSI website.

This is to inform that 24/02/2017 is the last date for submitting the fees for joining this society. Hurry up and get fully registered with the CSI and become a official member. If you are already done with this step skip to next paragraph. 

Also we are thinking of hosting some events in the upcoming TechFest of GNDEC. If you have some idea and want to organise an event please reply to this mail. We are also going to organise interview sessions for selecting executive members and event hosting will help you a lot for that too.

Happy coding
